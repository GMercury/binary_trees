# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Data structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.

### Basic Binary Tree

```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```

### Binary Search Tree
`typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;`
### AVL Tree
`typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;`
### Max Binary Heap
`typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;`

**Note**: For tasks 0 to 23 (included), you have to deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they don’t follow any kind of rule.

## Print function
To match the examples in the tasks, you are given [this function](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x1C.c)

This function is used only for visualization purposes. You don’t have to push it to your repo. It may not be used during the correction


# Tasks
## 0. New node

Write a function that creates a binary tree node

  * Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
  * Where `parent` is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
  * And `value` is the value to put in the new node
  * When created, a node does not have any child
  * Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or `NULL`  on failure
